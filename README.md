# FaceBookDesignSample
This HTML code creates a Facebook login page. The code has a Facebook logo in the header and a login form with fields for an email address or mobile number and a password. A major body section with a left and right portion is also included in the code. A quote and an image are in the left section, while a sign-up form is in the right section.

First name, last name, email address or cellphone number, password, birthday, and gender are all required fields on the registration form. The form also has a sign-up button and a checkbox for accepting the terms.
The code includes references to an external CSS file and two JavaScript files. The JavaScript files are used for form validation and jQuery functionality. The code can be used as a starting point for creating a functional Facebook login page.
